This is the backend for a "Cards Against humanity" style game, the rules are very similar to cards against humanity, but the answer mechanic has been changed to be a bit more freeform.

CAH rules that inspired this project: How to play Cards Against Humanity rules. One player picks a black card and reads the question or fill-in-the-blank phrase out loud.
The rest of the players submit a White answer card and attempt to form the most hilarious inappropriate combo. The card picker chooses the winner, and points are awarded.
